goOrganize
==========

goOrganizer is a very little utility to create a simple messagging system, where is possible to message to other people, simply using an email address.

The idea is to somehow simulate the issue format of website like github or bitbucket.

The idea is very basic:
- Dead simple web site

- Format using MarkDown

- Just email necessary to log in, no sign up necessary.

- After 7 days of inactivity the "thread" will be removed

- All thread are public

- For "pro" account thread will could be private and persistent
